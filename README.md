# Arduino Alarm Clock Code
Alarm clock built from scratch and prototyped with Arduino. Shows time of day, alarms at a set time, and has a USB port to allow for charging external devices.

## Description
The code was made to prototype the logic going into programming the actual project on the PCB board. Using the Arudino UNO with the  ATMega328 microcontroller and the Arduino progamming IDE based off of C++ I programmed the actions of the clock.

The fully built and programmed verison of the alarm clock was programmed in Atmel Studio and can be seen below.

## Tasks
- Prototype the code for the final alarm clock using the Arudino UNO with the ATMega328 microcontroller
- Design and build the alarm clock using a PCB board, microcontroller, and 8 bit display

## Example
